# Class and ID Selectors Assignment

This project focused on the practical use of class and ID attributes in HTML, as well as their corresponding selectors in CSS. By completing this assignment, I understand how to effectively style HTML elements using classes and IDs.

## Final Outcome
After completing the assignment, the following styling properties were applied:
### HTML Structure
1. **Odd numbered elements**:
   - Shared the same class (`odd`).
2. **Even numbered elements**:
   - Had unique IDs (`two` for the second element and `four` for the fourth element).
3. **Number 3 element**:
   - Used multiple classes (`odd adjust-font-size`).

### CSS Styling
1. **All odd-numbered elements**:
   - Background color: light red/pink (`hsl(350, 77%, 80%)`).
   - Font family: `Verdana`, `DejaVu Sans`, and `sans-serif`.
2. **Second element**:
   - Text color: blue (`hsl(233, 100%, 50%`).
   - Font size: 36px.
3. **Third element**:
   - Inherited the styles for odd-numbered elements.
   - Additional font size: 24px.
4. **Fourth element**:
   - Background color: light green (`hsl(120, 100%, 50%`).
   - Font size: 24px.
   - Font weight: bold.
